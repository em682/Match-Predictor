* Frank gets instantly benched.

* Doncic misses a 3 point stepback at 1:52 when Frank wasn't even in the game (why aren't you praising DSJ's defense?).

* Frank comes back for a defensive possession, we get scored on twice in a row.

* Frank scores the Free Throws after another mediocre 3 pts, 2 assists game in 18 minutes.

The fans obviously didn't know about his family member dying, but booing a player coming off an injury makes no sense. Of course the boos asking for Frank actually ended up working because Frank has been the go-to guy since, even with DSJ back, and has been playing well. Fiz had no answer for why Frank wasn't playing when the chants caused the media to question him after the game.


With that said, KP 100% deserves the boos and he'll get it for his whole career whenever he plays at the Garden. Every fanbase boos players. Your fanbase boo'd the fuck out of Fisher, and was asked to boo him by your owner. You're not allowed to have a moral high ground here. Fisher renegged on playing for the Mavs saying he wanted to be with his family, only to sign with OKC shortly after. KP missed half of his games as a Knick due to injury, said he was nowhere near being able to play only to post sprinting exercise videos online, asked the FO to give his brother a role, and wanted a max no questions asked early in the season when when we would have given him one after we made a run for two max FA's to put a good team around him. He also said that he would no longer play for the Knicks no matter what and said he would take the qualifying offer so he could be a UFA the year after, and said he'd spend the year in Madrid if the Knicks didn't trade him. He's played about 60% of his possible games as a Knick and wouldn't take a contract with any sort of injury incentives like Embiid, who is significantly better than him, was willing to take. 


You're allowed to like KP. He's your player, he's fantastic, and has a ton of potential. That said, you're not allowed to tell us to like him or not to boo him. I don't remember ever seeing a player force himself off his team during his rookie contract when he's barely played 50% of the possible games for his team.

Smaller market teams like the Kings, Milwaukee, Minnesota, Phoenix, all have had players leave and no one blames the franchise even though they‚Äôve been dysfunctional.

I blame Dolan more than anyone, but if you followed the Knicks in the last few years you know that he‚Äôs mostly been hands off. Sure his hiring of Jackson and promotion of Mills is a mistake, but I don‚Äôt inherently disagree with most of the moves Perry has made the last few years. If Booker left Phoenix the way KP left NY, no one would be blaming their FO the way that they blame ours even though Sarver is way worse than Dolan.

You‚Äôre looking like a real distasteful bunch with all the booing‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt that sound fucking retarded? To me, there‚Äôs no discussion as to whether or not KP did the Knicks wrong.

* The good was that RJ continued to contribute both in and out of the stats sheet. He's so slick bouncing off the defender going to his left.

There was one moment on transition Defense in the 4th where they both looked like they were in their own worlds while Lauri was drifting free on the perimeter. Lauri ended up having a clean shot that really could have changed the course of the game.  
* I'm not a basketball expert, so correct me if I'm not saying this right, but I really like the high-low action between RJ & Randle. Randle sets the screen and RJ passes out of the double-team to Randle in the paint. Randle's decision-making was a little slow, but I thought he handled those triple threat situations well in the fourth.   
* That's an organic play, though. I'm much less impressed with the rest of the play-calling. On one hand, I sympathize with Fiz because a lot of the players seem very resistant to setting good screens. On the other hand, good lord does the offense look stale.

1831,"Truthfully, while he has been actually great as a rookie and a 19 year old - he has quite a bit more work to do and has a number of flaws in his game. That's not a terrible thing - he has room to grow, as do all young players.   


* He's gotta get better at going right, well-organized mid-season defenses will lock down the left. He needs to counter because if he keeps trying to go left, that's where we'll see the efficiency drop. I'm relatively confident with his work ethic he'll sort this out.  

* While he's a solid PNR passer for his age (he leverages his size well, can beat the trap), his timing needs work. He can be a beat or two late on some of his passes, making for more difficult shots.

205," Well theres no daily discussion thread, its 3am here and I'm procrastinating studying.   So, if you guys were made in charge of the knicks. What would you do?  Personally. 

&#x200B;

The first thing I'd do is NOT trade Marcus morris right away. Wait for offers to come in. We want an offer to come around February when teams are getting more and more desperate. However, if a team offers you a first or a decent young player for him (Anfernee Simmons or Zach Collins svp) then take it and run. However, Morris' value will go up as the season progresses and teams are kinda scrambling to make moves (Tobias Harris move last year is a good example).   

&#x200B;

Secondly, just try to sell off what you can right now. There isn't a big chance you can get much for the other guys' bar Morris but it's worth a shot. Unless someone offers a second and a salary match for Portis? Take it as long as the deal expires in the summer. If not. Don't take it. Same applies for Taj Gibson (although he's probably the signing I hate the least this summer), Ellington and idek Bullock?   However, unless a miraculous offer comes our way. Do NOT trade Randle yet. Let him finish up the year. Do I like Randle? No. But you'll see my logic in the next paragraph  

&#x200B;

Third, (after the season is done), we will probably have a top 5 pick let's be honest. Which isn't bad. We will also hopefully have attained a mid-teens pick for Marcus morris and maybe a Salary dump or two. 

Anyways, about Julius Randle. It's clear that the fit between us and Randle is just fucking horrible. Particularly RJ and Randle. It is clunky, doesn't look good and doesn't benefit either of their playstyles. I do think that Randle isn't that good. But the contract we gave him, in all honesty. Isn't THAT bad. It's VERY VERY VERY tradeable. Next year it will be an expiring with a team option to extend. Just about the easiest type of contract to trade. We have no reason to salary dump him and attach it with assets. If no good offer comes along, simply keep him on the roster and most importantly, play him on limited minutes. 

Also, every single player the knicks have an option on, opt-out. The only player the Knicks should MAYBE consider bringing back is Taj Gibson because well idk. I just like Taj more than other players on our roster. And he's a good presence for Mitchell Robinson. However, if we lose him, no tears are shed.

&#x200B;

In the offseason, yes, this is possible one of the worst FA classes in a while. That being said, not all hope is lost. 

Steven Adams, Otto Porter (even tho he's playing okay this year), Evan Fournier (a little unfair to include him on this list, ik, but maybe the magic are looking to move on), Gorgiu Dieng, Dennis Schroeder, Cody Zeller, Batum, Kelly Olynk, Cristiano Felicio, KCP, Satoransky, Tony Snell, Trevor Ariza, Gordon Hayward if the injury woes are worse than anticipated,  and probably a bunch more that I forgot to mention. 

&#x200B;

These are all guys that teams might wanna get off of their contracts, particularly KCP and Cristiano Felicio (lmao). The knicks can potentially free up 40 million in cap space next year. That's a lot of money. We will roughly have 57.74 M in cap if we opt out of a bunch of contracts and maybe end up with roughly 50m depending on where we pick in the NBA draft (this is WITH randle still on the books)  

&#x200B;

What I would personally do is one of two things. Firstly,  try to sign Ingram to a fair contract that maybe the pelicans will/will not match. I'm thinking in the ballpark of 20-25 Million.

Secondly, since the first option is likely to not work, just load tf up on salary dumps and picks. As many as possible. 2nd rounders, first-rounders, anything is better than nothing. 

Also, shop around the league and see who is willing to buy players rn. A salary dump could be very attractive to other teams if a team needs one of our 'young core'. I'd be willing to shop around players like DSJr and maybe even Kevin Knox. A team will likely view this as a sweetener and would be willing to give up a first rounder in if it's a salary dump. 

Hypothetical example:

DSJr and Julius Randle for Otto Porter, Cristiano Felicio(or Satoransky) and a 2022 First round pick top 10 protected (or lottery protected) from the bulls and a 2020 second rounder. 

This is a fair and realistic trade for both sides imo - especially if the Bulls decide to trade high on markannen and cash out on his value. Then they'd have a hole at the 4 which julius randle can fill. Not to mention a young backup PG for Coby White. 

There are dozens of other realistic trades our FO can do this offseason. We as fans can only do so much.

&#x200B;

If I were to 'target' players this offseason to sign/acquire. Well, I think I would literally only target Brandon Ingram and maybe FVV.",lose,well theres daily discussion thread its 3am here and procrastinating studying you guys were made charge the knicks what would you personally the first thing not trade marcus morris right away wait for offers come want offer come around february when teams are getting more and more desperate however team offers you first decent young player for him anfernee simmons zach collins svp then take and run however morris value will the season progresses and teams are kinda scrambling make moves tobias harris move last year good example secondly just try sell off what you can right now there isn big chance you can get much for the other guys bar morris but worth shot unless someone offers second and salary match for portis take long the deal expires the summer not don take same applies for taj gibson although probably the signing hate the least this summer ellington and idek bullock however unless miraculous offer comes our way not trade randle yet let him finish the year like randle but you see logic the next paragraph third after the season done will probably have top pick let honest which isn bad will also hopefully have attained mid teens pick for marcus morris and maybe salary dump two anyways about julius randle clear that the fit between and randle just fucking horrible particularly and randle clunky doesn look good and doesn benefit either their playstyles think that randle isn that good but the contract gave him all honesty isn that bad very very very tradeable next year will expiring with team option extend just about the easiest type contract trade have reason salary dump him and attach with assets good offer comes along simply keep him the roster and most importantly play him limited minutes also every single player the knicks have option opt out the only player the knicks should maybe consider bringing back taj gibson because well idk just like taj more than other players our roster and good presence for mitchell robinson however lose him tears are shed the offseason yes this possible one the worst classes while that being said not all hope lost steven adams otto porter even tho playing okay this year evan fournier little unfair include him this list but maybe the magic are looking move gorgiu dieng dennis schroeder cody zeller batum kelly olynk cristiano felicio kcp satoransky tony snell trevor ariza gordon hayward the injury woes are worse than anticipated and probably bunch more that forgot mention these are all guys that teams might wanna get off their contracts particularly kcp and cristiano felicio lmao the knicks can potentially free million cap space next year that lot money will roughly have cap opt out bunch contracts and maybe end with roughly 50m depending where pick the nba draft this with randle still the books what would personally one two things firstly try sign ingram fair contract that maybe the pelicans will will not match thinking the ballpark million secondly since the first option likely not work just load salary dumps and picks many possible 2nd rounders first rounders anything better than nothing also shop around the league and see who willing buy players salary dump could very attractive other teams team needs one our young core willing shop around players like dsjr and maybe even kevin knox team will likely view this sweetener and would willing give first rounder salary dump hypothetical example dsjr and julius randle for otto porter cristiano felicio satoransky and 2022 first round pick top protected lottery protected from the bulls and 2020 second rounder this fair and realistic trade for both sides imo especially the bulls decide trade high markannen and cash out his value then they have hole the which julius randle can fill not mention young backup for coby white there are dozens other realistic trades our can this offseason fans can only much were target players this offseason sign acquire well think would literally only target brandon ingram and maybe fvv ,"['well', 'theres', 'daily', 'discussion', 'thread', '3am', 'procrastinating', 'studying', 'guys', 'made', 'charge',

273,"I personally would try to trade Morris for a pick. I doubt we would get a decent/good young player out of him unless we included one of our own. My next priority would be to trade Bobby Portis. I would trade him for a 2nd rounder just to get him off the team in all honesty. I would want to keep RJ, Randle, Iso Zo, Mitch, Taj, Frank, Iggy, and Knox. I wouldn't mind getting rid of Knox but if we dont get anything for him, I'd like to keep him but he could be used as a sweetener for a trade.

I would trade DSJ for anything at this point. Obviously nobody with a long term, costly contract, but he has been horrendous. I would like to get rid of Elfrid too if we could get something small but I also don't mind keeping him as a backup for Frank as a worst case scenario. Wayne, Reggie, Allen, Rabb, and Dot are all fine to stay as well but I wouldnt be mad to use them as a sweetener in a trade.

If possible, if we could bundle some of these players with a future pick, I would be all in for trading for Lonzo Ball. Doesn't seem like he fits in in NO. The only conflict that arises is that it does not help our backcourt 3 point shooting. But I think Lonzo is an elite distributer and could contribute especially if RJ can work on his shot. Then we could start Knox at SF and he has the potential to shoot well from 3.  

Ideally, I would avoid FVV because I think that he will get a BIG contract. If we could get him on a similar contract as Randle, I would be fine with it though. However, I think this is a good free agent class for good pieces for a winning team, just not the superstar. I would try to go after Joe Harris if he'd take 10 mil a year and I would also go after Montrezl Harrell and I may go up to 15 for both depending on how the market looks. If Drummond opts out of his contract I would potentially look to sign him but definitely not for max money, which is what he probably will look for.
