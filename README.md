# Match-Predictor

## Plans
Use Reddit API to get comments of past 10 (~10000 comments) win game threads and 10 (~10000 comments)loss game threads. Analyze comments of win threads and loss threads to create ML classification model. These datasets are used as training. Then we predict by testing the model for next games.
